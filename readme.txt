NYC-TLC trip data analysis project, using Spark techniques
by Henry Morgan

Instructions for USE:
Works with NYC TLC trip data files

Please add your personal data path locations at the top of file t1, your shapefile directory at the top of file t2, and your taxi-zone lookup csv directory at the top of t4.
Please also run these notebooks from the same folder - they rely on variables being passed from one to the other, and this will only work if they are run from the same location.
