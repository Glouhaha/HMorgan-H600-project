NYC-TLC trip data analysis project, using Spark techniques
by Henry Morgan

Instructions for USE:

Please add your personal data path locations at the top of file t1, your shapefile directory at the top of file t2, and your taxi-zone lookup csv directory at the top of t4 - these will then be carried across the other files, and you will not need to type them multiple times.

Please also run these notebooks from the same folder - again, they rely on variables being passed from one to the other, and this will only work if they are run from the same location.
